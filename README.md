# PLUGIN: Regional stock status for WooCommerce

This plugin allows a shop owner/admin to define a country or list of countries for which a particular variation is shown as in stock, making said variation unavailable for countries which do not form part of the list.

## Changing settings

Once the plugin is activated, users can navigate to the Regional Stock Status tab of the product edit screen for variable products. Each variation can have assigned to it a unique list of countries for stock inclusion, along with a unique out of stock message for each variation, which will be shown on the single product page once a matching variation is selected for purchase from a user who resides in a country which is not whitelisted.

The add to cart button is automatically disabled for these products on variation select to avoid accidental additions to cart.

## Compatibility

This plugin has been built specifically for use with the Flatsome theme. Compatibility with other WordPress themes to be determined.

## Possible future add-on functionality

- Support for all product types
- Wider WordPress theme compatibility
- Support for provincial/state level exclusions
